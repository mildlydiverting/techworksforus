This is a test to see if the blog publishes from the CMS. Let's add some content.


Dithering saves some file size for iamges (gif, png) whilst maintaing detail. It was used by LowTech as an aesthetic statement as much as an efficiency one. 
See:

https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html

There's a lot of discussion about how well it works as a compression tactic

I quite like it as an aesthetic signal that youre thinking about the file size.

We may want to use WebP images - they are much much more efficient but taking a while to catch on. 

https://redketchup.io/image-compressor allow syou to compress images and export in different formats.
