### The lawful basis for using your personal information

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the lawful bases we rely on for processing this information are: 

* We have your consent - when you have unambiguously and freely agreed to share your information with us. You are able to withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting \[DATA EMAIL]
* We have a contractual obligation - when we have a contractual relationship with you to provide services you’ve requested, or have a contractual agreement with a supplier or a client to process your information.
* We have a legal obligation - when we need to store records of your consent or opt-out for using your data, or when a law enforcement authority uses its legal powers to make us share information.
* We have a legitimate interest - when we could not operate our business without processing your information in some way.

### How we store your personal information 

We store your information in different ways depending on the type of data. It may be on secure remote servers, held locally on password protected devices or as hard-copies which will be filed in locked cabinets. We use secure, regularly updated passwords and two-factor authentication for services where available. Data transferred to remote servers will be sent over an encrypted connection.

We use third party services and online platforms to host our website, store files, host video calls and workshops, manage our finances, and deliver other business processes as part of our work. These services manage the data from these tools on our behalf, governed by the contracts we have with them,  and their terms of service and privacy policies. 

This website is built using \[SERVICE], which stores data in data centres across the United States. We have agreed to their Terms of Service, and to their Data Processing Addendum. This is their Privacy Policy.

We may also embed content from third party social sites, or from Google Documents. 

Code for Google Tag Manager / Analytics is automatically embedded in the header of this website by \[SERVICE], but is not configured to report data.
