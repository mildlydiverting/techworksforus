A selection of past work 

#### Butterfly Conservation

Tech Works For Us is currently working with [Butterfly Conservation](https://butterfly-conservation.org/) in partnership with the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/) on their Supporting Science project, developing tools for volunteer record verifiers.  

> Martha has brought fresh eyes to our project and assisted a detail-focused team to structure our work around the big picture and user needs. She has helped us understand and select the right approach and introduced research and product management techniques that would have been outside of our comfort zone without support. 
>
> Martha led development of the research framework, conducted interviews and testing and led developer meetings. Weâ€™ve therefore been able to focus staff time on our strengths and work collaboratively and confidently with delivery partners. Martha has taken care to thoroughly understand our team, the complex topic and diverse volunteer user base. 
>
> I would recommend Tech Works For Us to any digital project for which the process is as important as the tech you are creating; Martha will help you to clarify and document that process and end up with a clear roadmap of how you got there and what could come next.
