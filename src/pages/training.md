We offer a range of workshops on different aspects of digital strategy and development. These can be tailored to your particular organisational needs and challenges and can be offered as standalone sessions or as part of a bigger project with you.. [Get in touch](https://www.techworksforus.com/contact/) to discuss details and pricing.

* **U﻿ser research.** Do you want to find out more about your potential audiences or current users so you can better meet their needs? Robust user research needs to be targeted to produce usable insight and employ appropriate methodologies to answer different questions, we can show you how to do this successfully and within your available resources. 
* **I﻿mplementing user insight.** Now you have lots of user data, what do you do with it? How do you interpret it? How do you turn it into a roadmap for developing your offer? As well as facilitating this process as part of our consultancy work, we can also train you and your team in doing this for yourselves.
* **C﻿reating a brief.** Digital procurement can be a huge headache for smaller organisations in particular. How you do make sure you put the right information in the brief and identify the best supplier for you? We have tools to share and processes to work through with you to take the pain out of procurement.
* **I﻿terative design/game design.** Our fun and practical game design workshop is a good primer on interactive product design of any sort, or even as a team building experience. But it can also lead to playable games to use in your own engagement, educational or training projects. For more on game design workshops run by our lead consultant, Martha,[ see her own website](https://marthahenson.com/game-design-workshops/) with more details and testimonials from past participants.
