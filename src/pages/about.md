We know how daunting it can be to untangle stakeholder and user needs to make a good plan for a digital project, to decide which tools and platforms to invest organisational time and money in, to find the time to oversee complex digital development, to write a good brief or funding bid or, sometimes, to even know where to start.

## Sustainability and social impact

Minimising the impact of digital products and services on the environment is at the heart of our values. Web traffic can produce a surprising amount of carbon emissions, the scale of which is only now getting wider recognition. 

Luckily, there are some straightforward things you can do to help keep this to a minimum; we are keeping an eye on research and best practice in this area in order to build this into our advice for you. We also consider social factors to prevent unwanted consequences and make sure that digital project meet ours and your ethical standards.

## About Our Founder

Martha Henson is our founder but brings in other expert consultants, developers and specialists as needed. An early adopter of Internet technologies, Martha started building websites in the mid 90s. Back then, the web was a glorious mess of frantic Notepad-built special interest websites, X-Files Usenet groups and unregulated chatrooms. It’s come a long way since, and so has she.

Today, she can draw on a long and varied history of work in “digital”. This has included product management, content production from filmmaking to writing, user research and analysis, project evaluation and digital strategy. She has worked in broadcast, the cultural sector, edtech, healthtech, the charitable sector and beyond.

She has taught digital production skills for Syracuse University, the National Film and Television School and the Arts Marketing Association amongst others, and has written and spoken widely. She is a mentor for leading Tech for Good accelerator Bethnal Green Ventures and has mentored for the National Lottery Heritage Fund.
